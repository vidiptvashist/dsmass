    "### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)\n",

    "\n",
    "SOAP relies exclusively on XML to provide messaging services. Microsoft originally developed SOAP to take the place of older technologies that don’t work well on the internet The point is that SOAP is highly extensible, but you only use the pieces you need for a particular task. For example, when using a public web service that’s freely available to everyone, you really don’t have much need for WS-Security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### REST (Representational State Transfer) \n",
    "is another standard, made in response to SOAP’s shortcomings. It seeks to fix the problems with SOAP and provide a simpler method of accessing web services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using XML to make a request, REST (usually) relies on a simple URL. In some situations you must provide additional information, but most web services using REST rely exclusively on using the URL approach. REST can use four different HTTP 1.1 verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shortcoming of SOAP\n",
    "SOAP uses XML format that must be parsed to be read. It defines many standards that must be followed while developing the SOAP applications. So it is slow and consumes more bandwidth and resource"
